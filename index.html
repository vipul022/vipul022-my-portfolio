          Hello! I am Vipul Seth from Melbourne, Australia. I moved to Australia in 2015 with my wife. I am currently doing Diploma of IT at Coders Academy. Before this, I had been working as a service provider at UPS for three years. I am very passionate about playing cricket. But unfortunately last year I got my knee injured while playing cricket and due to that I could not work for four months. I always had desire to make my carrier in IT, so I utilized that time very well in doing some research and started doing self study. I obtained ISTQB certification for software testing during that period. I continued studying HTML,CSS,Javascript from various online resources. In February, 2020 I took a step forward  by resigning from my job and getting enrolled in this course to learn more about web development.
