            Hello! I am Vipul Seth from Melbourne, Australia. I moved to
            Australia in 2015 with my wife. I am currently doing a Diploma of IT
            at Coders Academy. Before this, I had been working as a service
            provider at UPS for three years. I am very passionate about playing
            cricket. But unfortunately last year I got my knee injured while
            playing cricket and due to that I could not work for four months. I
            always had a desire to make my career in IT, so I utilized that time
            very well in doing some research and started doing self-study. I
            obtained ISTQB certification for software testing during that
            period. I continued studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from various
            online resources. Later, I took a step forward and enrolled in this
            course to learn more about web development.
